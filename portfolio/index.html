			<h2>Allen Stone - Naturally</h2>
			<p>This is a song that really stood out to me.  Even unedited it sounded really good and I thought, what better way to start my journey into mixing and mastering songs than one I would listen to myself.  Whilst listening back to my mix I realised some things I could have done better.  I realised I actually turned the bass element down really low in the mix so when listening you can't actually hear the bass instrument.  This is something I can work on fixing by improving the static mix throughout the mixing progress.  I actually did this with the guitar during the mastering process as I found, the solo I had given the guitar was too loud in the mix.  This meant that if i were to cater for the majority of the song it would peak during the break, and if I focussed on the peaks I would end up with a really quiet song.  One of the other notable issues was with the feel of the song.  Where I had improved it and tidied the audio up I had also over compressed it so it sounded really tinny.  I will have to keep this in mind for next time so I can try and avoid this issue.</p>

		<p>I took the songs from a <a href="https://www.cambridge-mt.com/ms/mtk/">Cambridge Music Technology</a> website.  It has a really large selection of songs which are free to take and practice on. I searched for a while to find something like this as I knew something like this would exist.</p>
		<p>When learning to master I used the lessons taught by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEHf57RoC4s&list=PLVwn0Z_ucW6GnO3-YLdCEW1FYhahRUseV">Recording Revolutions</a> on YouTube.  He was very knowledgable about the subject and I knew he was very passionate about what he was doing.</p>
